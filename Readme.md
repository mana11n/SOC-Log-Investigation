# SOC Log Investigation Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates SOC-style investigation of Linux authentication and web server logs to identify malicious activity and false positives. The goal is to simulate Tier-1 SOC triage using raw logs and Linux command-line tools without relying on a SIEM.

## Objectives
- Analyze SSH authentication logs to detect brute-force attempts
- Investigate web server access logs for reconnaissance behavior
- Distinguish true security threats from benign user activity
- Document findings using SOC reasoning and evidence

## Tools & Environment
- Linux (Ubuntu/Kali)
- Logs: auth.log, Apache access.log
- Tools: grep, awk, sort, uniq, less

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Log analysis
- Incident triage
- Threat vs false-positive identification
- SOC documentation and reporting

## Disclaimer
Logs used are sanitized and simulated for educational purposes.
